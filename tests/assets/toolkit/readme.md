You can use the following link to access our shared folder:

[Toolkit project folder (Dropbox)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/j77r55l7le5rpplcvhefb/ALWp6zsQ7M99s0TCVlhwEi4?rlkey=3b6mc6qxxcblb61c28ug4df3p&st=cmbqu3ey&dl=0)

IMPORTANT: You do not need to manually download files from the Dropbox shared folder. See the slide "The tk_utils module" for more information.

The structure of the shared folder

The structure of the shared folder is the same as in your toolkit project folder. 

```
toolkit/
|__ data/                            <- The data files in dropbox are optional
|
|__ lectures/                        <- Companion codes will go in here (see discussion below)
|   |__ solutions/                   <- Completed version of the companion codes will go here
|
|__ in_class/                        <- Codes discussed during class go here
|
|__ event_study/                     <- Codes for Lectures 9, 10, and 11 (starting in week 8)

```


I will add files to the shared folder as we progress through the course.

Below is a description of each folder depicted above.

### The data folder

This folder includes the data files discussed in the lectures and during class. New files will be added as we progress through the course.

### The lectures folder

The lectures folder includes all "companion codes" discussed in the lectures. 

```
<DROPBOX_SHARED_FOLDER>/
|       ...
|__ lectures/                    <-- Scaffold version of the companion codes           
|   |__ solutions/                    <-- Will be populated after each lecture
|   |
|   |__ lec_avgs_example.py
|   |__ lec_fileio.py
|   |__ lec_pd_bools.py
|   |__ lec_pd_csv.py
|   |__ lec_pd_dataframes.py
|   |__ lec_pd_datetime.py
|   |__ lec_pd_groupby.py
|   |__ lec_pd_indexing.py
|   |__ lec_pd_joins.py
|   |__ lec_pd_numpy.py
|   |__ lec_pd_series.py
...
```




Below is the lecture in which each companion code is first discussed:

Lecture 4.6:

lec_fileio.py

Lecture 5.1:

lec_avgs_example.py

Lecture 5.2:

lec_pd_series.py

lec_pd_dataframes.py

Lecture 5.3:

lec_pd_numpy.py

Lecture 6.1:

lec_pd_indexing.py

Lecture 6.2:

lec_pd_csv.py

Lecture 7.1:

lec_pd_datetime.py

Lecture 9.1:

lec_pd_joins.py

Lecture 9.2:

lec_pd_bools.py

Lecture 9.3:

lec_pd_groupby.py

The "solutions" sub-folder will include the completed version of the companion codes. It will be populated as we go through the lectures.

The in_class folder

This folder will include any code we discuss during class.

The event_study folder (available after Week 8)

I will create a new folder with the completed version of the event study (Lec 9, 10, 11). These are provided for your reference only. I strongly encourage you to create these modules yourself as you progress through the lectures in ED.  If you get stuck, you can then refer to the completed version of the codes in Dropbox.
